ia32 directory contains pintool for 32bit binaries, whereas intel64 contains tool for 64bit.
It was created using PIN 2.14, and may require installing libdwarf.so, 
libelf.so, or other libraries, if you do not already have them.  Please
refer to Pin documentation for working with Pin 2.14.

Use pintool like this:

	pin -t <tool_path> -controller_skip <skip> -controller_length <length> -o <outfile> -- <binary>

Supported knobs are:

-controller_skip <n> 	: Number of instructions to skip. Provide value 1 or more than that.
-controller_length <n>	: Number of instructions to instrument.
-o <str>		: Output file name. Give name in format *.gz
	
For example, you could trace 200,000 instructions of the program ls, after
skipping the first 100,000 instructions, with this command:

pin -t intel64/control.so -o ls.trace.gz -controller_skip 100000 -controller_length 200000 -- ls

Traces created with this tool are in binary format and captured before L1 level cache.
